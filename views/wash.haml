      %p
        Group all your Nerdies in sets. (ok, and other garments if you really have to or don't have enough Nerdies to fill up your washing machine). Now pay attention! Each set should consist of items in similar colors.

      %p
        Why? Turns out when you wash similar clothes together, they are more likely to find a match for themselves--a nice nerdy similar significant other--and this makes them happy. Keep your Nerdies happy!
